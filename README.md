# snap collector plugin - load
This plugin collects metrics from /proc/loadavg kernel interface about load average figures giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  

It's used in the [snap framework](http://github.com:intelsdi-x/snap).

## Getting Started
### System Requirements
* [golang 1.4+](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Operating systems
All OSs currently supported by snap:
* Linux/amd64

### Installation
#### Download load plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-load  
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-load.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs/`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Ensure `$SNAP_PATH` is exported  
`export SNAP_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/build`

## Documentation

### Collected Metrics
This plugin has the ability to gather the following metrics:

Namespace | Description (optional)
----------|-----------------------
/intel/procfs/load/min1 | number of jobs in the run queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1 minute
/intel/procfs/load/min5 | number of jobs in the run queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 5 minutes
/intel/procfs/load/min15 | number of jobs in the run queue (state R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 15 minutes
/intel/procfs/load/scheduling | Two numbers separated by a slash (/). The first is the number of currently runnable kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads). The second is the number of kernel scheduling entities that currently exist on the system

### Examples
Example running load, passthru processor, and writing data to a file.

This is done from the snap directory.

In one terminal window, open the snap daemon (in this case with logging set to 1 and trust disabled):
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapd -l 1 -t 0
```

In another terminal window:
Load load plugin
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load snap-plugin-collector-load
```
See available metrics for your system
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl metric list
```

Create a task manifest file (e.g. `load-file.json`):    
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "schedule": {
        "type": "simple",
        "interval": "1s"
    },
    "workflow": {
        "collect": {
            "metrics": {
                "/intel/procfs/load/min1": {},
                "/intel/procfs/load/min15": {},
                "/intel/procfs/load/scheduling": {}
            },
            "config": {
                "/intel/mock": {
                    "password": "secret",
                    "user": "root"
                }
            },
            "process": [
                {
                    "plugin_name": "passthru",
                    "process": null,
                    "publish": [
                        {                         
                            "plugin_name": "file",
                            "config": {
                                "file": "/tmp/published_load"
                            }
                        }
                    ],
                    "config": null
                }
            ],
            "publish": null
        }
    }
}
```

Load passthru plugin for processing:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load build/plugin/snap-processor-passthru
Plugin loaded
Name: passthru
Version: 1
Type: processor
Signed: false
Loaded Time: Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:44:03 PST
